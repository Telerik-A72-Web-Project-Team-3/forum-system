## Architecture

The application follows a **layered architecture** pattern with clear separation of concerns:

**Presentation Layer**:
- MVC Controllers (Thymeleaf) for web interface at `/forum`, `/auth`, `/admin`
- REST Controllers (JSON API) for programmatic access at `/api/*`

**Business Logic Layer**:
- Service classes handle business rules, authorization checks, and transaction management
- Services validate operations and ensure users can only modify their own content (or admins can moderate)

**Data Access Layer**:
- JPA Repositories abstract database operations
- Custom repository implementations for complex queries (JPQL and native SQL)

**Database Layer**:
- MariaDB with relational schema
- Entities: User, Post, Comment, Folder, Tag, PostView (view tracking)
- Relationships: Many-to-many for likes and tags, one-to-many for posts/comments, self-referential for folder hierarchy

**Security Layer** (cross-cutting):
- JWT authentication filter validates tokens on every request
- Spring Security manages authorization with role-based access control
- BCrypt encrypts passwords

**Key Design Patterns**:
- Repository Pattern for data access
- Service Layer Pattern for business logic
- DTO Pattern for API data transfer
- Soft Delete Pattern for non-destructive deletion
- Builder Pattern (Lombok) for object construction

---

## Security

The application implements several security measures:

- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **BCrypt Password Hashing**: Passwords encrypted with BCrypt (work factor: 10)
- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: JWT stored in HTTP-only cookies for web app (prevents XSS)
- **Role-Based Access Control**: USER and ADMIN roles with different permissions
- **Input Validation**: Bean Validation (JSR-380) on all DTOs
- **SQL Injection Protection**: JPA parameterized queries
- **Authorization Checks**: Service layer validates user permissions (owner or admin)
- **Soft Delete**: Maintains data integrity and audit trails

**Note for Production**:
- Enable HTTPS and set `secure` flag on cookies
- Store JWT secret in environment variables (not properties files)
- Add rate limiting for login endpoints
- Enable CSRF protection for web forms

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- MariaDB 10.6+ or MySQL 8.0+
- Gradle (wrapper included)
- IDE with Lombok support (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

### Environment Setup

Before running the application, ensure Java is properly configured:

**Windows:**
1. Verify Java 17 is installed: Open Command Prompt and run `java -version`
2. If Java is not found, set JAVA_HOME:
   - Find your Java installation (typically `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17` or similar)
   - Open System Properties → Environment Variables
   - Add new System Variable:
     - Variable name: `JAVA_HOME`
     - Variable value: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17` (your actual Java path)
   - Add to Path: `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`
   - Restart your terminal/PowerShell

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk  # or your Java path
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

**Verify setup:**
```bash
# Windows (Command Prompt)
echo %JAVA_HOME%

# Windows (PowerShell)
echo $env:JAVA_HOME

# Linux/Mac
echo $JAVA_HOME

# All platforms - should show Java 17
java -version
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd forum-system
```

2. **Create the database**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE forum_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

3. **Run database migrations**

The SQL files are migrations that must be executed in order. Run all schema migrations first, then all seed data migrations:

```bash
# Run schema
mysql -u your_username -p forum_db < src/main/resources/db/schema.sql

# Run seed data
mysql -u your_username -p forum_db < src/main/resources/db/seed-forum.sql
```

**Note**: Dev versions of the db are separated by migration version. If you run the dev scripts, make sure you run each
migration v1-v2-v3-v4-v5 in order.
Each migration builds on the previous one. Skipping files or running them out of order will cause errors.

**Migration Summary**:
- **schema_v4.sql**: Migrates `is_admin` boolean to `role` enum (ADMIN/MODERATOR/USER)
- **schema_v5.sql**: Adds `description` field to folders table
- **seed-forum-v6.sql**: Seeds 30 movie/series folders, 45 users (3 admins, 5 moderators, 37 users), 450 posts, 2700 comments

4. **Configure application secrets**

Create `src/main/resources/application-secrets.properties`:
```properties
# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/forum_db
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

# JWT Configuration
jwt.secret=your_secret_key_at_least_256_bits
jwt.expiration=86400000
```

5. **Run the application**
```bash
# Using Gradle wrapper (Windows)
gradlew.bat bootRun

# Using Gradle wrapper (Linux/Mac)
./gradlew bootRun
```

The application will start on http://localhost:8080

## Performance & Limits

The application enforces the following validation rules and limits:

### Content Limits

| Field | Minimum | Maximum | Notes |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Post Title** | 16 chars | 64 chars | Required |
| **Post Content** | 32 chars | 8192 chars | Markdown supported |
| **Comment Content** | 1 char | 8192 chars | Markdown supported |
| **Username** | 4 chars | 50 chars | Immutable after creation |
| **First/Last Name** | 4 chars | 32 chars | Required |
| **Email** | - | - | Valid email format, unique |
| **Phone** | - | 32 chars | Optional |
| **Folder Name** | 1 char | 64 chars | Required |
| **Folder Description** | - | 255 chars | Optional (schema v5) |
| **Tag Name** | 1 char | 50 chars | Unique, lowercase |
| **Tags per Post** | 0 | 3 | Optional |

### File Upload Limits

- **Avatar Images**: 5MB max file size
- **Allowed Formats**: Common image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
- **Storage Location**: `uploads/avatars/` (local filesystem)

### Pagination Defaults

- **Default Page Size**: 10 items per page
- **Posts per Folder**: Configurable in pagination requests
- **Comments**: All comments loaded per post (no pagination)

### Database Constraints

- **Unique Daily Views**: One view record per user per post per day
- **Soft Deletes**: Deleted posts/comments/users remain in database with `is_deleted = true`
- **Immutable Username**: Database trigger prevents username changes after creation
- **Blocked User Protection**: Database triggers prevent blocked users from posting/commenting

### Performance Features

- **Database Indexing**: Indexes on `role`, `username`, `email`, `slug`, and foreign keys
- **Lazy Loading**: JPA relationships configured for optimal query performance
- **View Tracking Optimization**: Unique constraint on `(user_id, post_id, view_date)` prevents duplicate counting
- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination to reduce response size

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
# Windows
gradlew.bat test

# Linux/Mac
./gradlew test
```

**Note:** If you get "JAVA_HOME is not set" error, see the [Environment Setup](#environment-setup) section above to configure Java.

The project includes unit tests for:
- User service (CRUD, authentication, blocking)
- Post service (CRUD, likes, view tracking)
- Folder service (hierarchy, slug generation)
- Comment service (CRUD, authorization)
- Tag repository (search, creation)

Tests use Mockito for mocking dependencies and JUnit 5 for assertions.
